## Installation

- Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls/releases) tab

- This program works with bookmarks, which are currently only supported by Mediocre Mapper or json editing. So you need that.

## Usage

Please read the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls/wiki) for a detailed Tutorial on how to use them. Short Version below.

Drag a Song Folder into the .exe to launch the configuration setup. 
After it run successful You will find a created Default File in your Folder of the selected Song.
This File defines the walls for the selected difficulty.
To create the Walls just run the .exe. To select a different File just drag in the Folder again.

### ***WARNING*** 

Currently this program will delete existing Walls, I have plans to change that

## other stuff

Windows will probably annoy you that this program is dangerous. If you dont want this, build from source or buy me a certificate
